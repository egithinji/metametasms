This is the sms sending module of the system developed by the metameta team at the Africa's Talking hackathon of July 28th 2022.

It provides an enpoint `send_message` that receives two parameters: a destination telephone number and a message.

It then uses Africa's Talking's api to send a message to the destination telephone number, informing them of the status of their water application.
